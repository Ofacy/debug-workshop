# About compiler flags
On using -g, -g1, -g2, -g3...
Request debugging information and also use level to specify how much information. 

The default level is 2.

- Level 0 produces no debug information at all. Thus, -g0 negates -g.
- Level 1 produces minimal information, enough for making backtraces in parts of the program that you donâ€™t plan to debug. This includes descriptions of functions and external variables, and line number tables, but no information about local variables.
- Level 3 includes extra information, such as all the macro definitions present in the program. Some debuggers support macro expansion when you use -g3.
